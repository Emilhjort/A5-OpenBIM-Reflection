## Introduction
For the final assignment, we will be reflecting on our use case, an LCA tool that tries to streamline the process of conducting a building LCA by extracting data from a BIM model, and the journey we have been on in terms of OpenBIM since the commencement of the course. 

## The journey and what lies ahead
There is no doubt that at the beginning of the course, we were both modelers (level 1). At the start of the course, we both assumed that Advanced BIM would be a more detail-oriented modeling course, but we quickly learned that the course extends beyond a mere emphasis on modeling and OpenBIM encompasses more aspects like collaboration, transparency, industry standardization for consistency and compatibility, etc. Now that we are at the end of the course, we have taken a step up the BIM hierarchy and become Analysts (level 3). It is not a big step, but nonetheless, we find it to be sufficient since we can see a progression in our BIM skills and way of thinking.

Since we have only taken one step up the BIM hierarchy, there are plenty of things we still need to learn and become familiar with.

### Self Learner
From our understanding of the Self-learner level, we would say that a prerequisite to reaching this level is to be able to create completely new scripts/tools from scratch. We felt like we were heavily lacking in this area and therefore do not see ourselves as fully Self-learners in BIM. To reach this level we would either need to improve our coding skills or gain further knowledge regarding BIM at the higher levels as coding skills are not everything in BIM. 

### OpenBIM Manager
The manager step is a role we have very lightly dabbled in throughout assignments A1-A5. Though we have made our own BPMN diagrams and applied them to a specific use case and analyzed data in an IFC file through the generation of Excel files, we still need to gain experience with the tasks of an OpenBIM manager and further familiarize ourselves with standards like the ISO 19650.

### OpenBIM Ontologist
Similar to the OpenBIM manager, we have worked with tasks related to the Ontologist role. We have tried to analyze the extracted data from a standard IFC file in Excel and our specific use case we tried to further extend the properties of the wall types in our IFC model by adding them to the used classification system. We still need to learn more about the classification systems. Additionally, we are pretty green when it comes to working with Linked Data and the benefits it provides, which is one of the areas an Ontologist also works with. 

### OpenBIM Guru
An OpenBIM Guru/champion is a person who has mastered the other roles and specializes in some of them. The role of a BIM guru also includes the ability to support, provide guidance, and explain BIM concepts and tasks to others at an appropriate level. In assignment A4, we took on the role of an OpenBIM Guru to explain our use case to BIM analysts. Though our experience with the task felt like a success, based on the feedback, we are still lacking in some fundamental areas, as mentioned in the previous sections/ BIM hierarchy levels, to take on the role of an OpenBIM Guru for the other roles. 

### OpenBIM in the future
Regarding our current tool and further development, OpenBIM can be employed for optimized BIM integration in LCA analysis, streamlining better collaboration and efficient exchange of information between appointing and appointed parties within sustainable building practices.
The widespread utilization of OpenBIM can play a crucial role in optimizing collaboration and efficiency across the engineering, architecture, and construction industries. OpenBIM provides various building roles for the opportunity to share and research essential tools and knowledge that might not be available otherwise, promoting enhanced interoperability and streamlined workflows. The advantage of OpenBIM is that it is not confined to any specific profession or industry, making it a valuable asset for a wide range of companies worldwide. As an example, one of us is currently working with BIM/CAD coordination and development at a Danish company and aims to integrate the use of OpenBIM into the workflow for further effective improvement during the development phase of different tools. 

## Process of the developing & course reflection
Throughout the course, we found ourselves with more questions and doubts than answers, frequently uncertain about the courseâ€™s objectives. Approaching the conclusion of the course the objectives became somewhat clearer. However, we found ourselves in a situation where time constraints prevented us from achieving our desired final goals, primarily because we had spent several weeks with a lack of understanding of the specific objectives. Eventually, we obtained a successful tool with tutorials for our case study, but would have preferred to have received clearer information much earlier in the course. 
Receiving information late in the course that the primary focus was on the journey rather than the individual coding skills, made the course more engaging and interesting. However, this crucial information was communicated way too late in the course.
Overall, the course process lacked some kind of clarity from the beginning, and the course process and structure did not effectively enable us to answer or define questions essential for later thesis, given the self-learning process of the course.
While the freedom to choose the use case was appreciated, the confusion within the course process made it challenging to precisely define a product, as the goal of the course was not clearly stated from the beginning.

## Received feedback on the tutorial
The tool effectively addressed the identified use case, but the testing group had some challenges in executing the script, because of issues with the initial code segment provided by the teachers, which they sometimes also had with their own code. Once this section was cleared out the remaining code worked smoothly giving the intended output.
The connection between the tutorial text, videos, and images was very coherent, and the overall structure of the guide in general was very good. The testing group specifically mentioned that the structure of the markdown file seemed very professional. The testing group commended the connection between the purpose of our tool for the use case. They thought that the scope was very well defined in the introduction of the tutorial. 

## Conclusion
To conclude the reflection, the course lacked a better structure and overall clarity early in the course. Nevertheless, we have managed to enhance our BIM skills and mindset towards a more comprehensive workflow regarding BIM integration. The journey was very challenging, but the results proved to be quite satisfying. 
We have possessed a broader and improved understanding of various aspects of BIM and will be able to apply these new skills in our ongoing professional development within the field of engineering.
Before this course, we both had finished several BIM modeling courses. However, it was interesting to discover that BIM encompasses so much more than just the creation of 3D models, but it actually involves a much broader set of concepts and applications.
